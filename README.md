A customizable **Polyhedral Dice Generator** for OpenSCAD.

![Image of dice](images/render_v0.27.5.png)

## Requirements

- OpenSCAD <http://www.openscad.org>
- The BOSL2 library <https://github.com/revarbat/BOSL2#installation>

## Adding Text to Dice

Text, numbers, underscores, and symbols are added to dice by creating lists of values. The elements within each list are rendered in the same order that the sides of the die are generated and is controlled by the BOSL2 library. Distributing elements to specific sides of each die is done by reordering the elements within each list.

***Note:** Element positions correlate across all lists, e.g., if the numbers list has `"9"` in the first position, and you want to add an underscore, the `"_"` should also be in the first position in the underscores list.*

***Note:** Each list will contain a number of elements equal to the number of characters rendered on the die, e.g., 6 elements for the d6, 8 for the d8, 12 for the d4, etc. There is one exception:*

- *A crystal d4c is a 6 sided cube with 4 numbered sides and 2 opossing points. The distribution lists for the d4c contain 6 elements, 2 of them being `" "` blank.*

### Distribution Lists

- **Text** - Consists of numbers, letters, or properly escaped unicode characters within the defined font (e.g., `"\u263C"` will produce â˜¼). If you'd like to use periods instead of underscores, that can be done in this list (e.g., `"6."` and `"9."`). The following example shows the standard number distribution for the d6.

  ***Example:*** `d6_text=["1","3","5","2","4","6"];`
  - Bracket enclosed `[]` quoted `" "` elements seperated by commas `,`.
  - Blanking out an element `" "` will prevent it from being rendered.
  - The font is set using the `text_font`variable.

- **Symbols** - A list for adding symbols. In the following example the symbol mapped to the letter `"K"` will be rendered in place of the number 4.

  ***Example:*** `d6_symbols=[undef,undef,undef,undef,"K",undef];`
  - Bracket enclosed `[]` quoted `" "` characters seperated by commas `,`.
  - The value `undef` or `"undef"` is used where a symbol is not wanted.
  - The symbol mapped to the character entered will be rendered using the `symbol_font` variable.

  ***Note:** After making changes to symbol elements the Customizer may wrap unquoted `undef` values in quotes as `"undef"`. The quotes will not affect opperation and can be ignored.*

- **Underscores** - A list for adding underscores. In the following example an underscore will be rendered under the number 6.

  ***Example:*** `d6_underscores=[" "," "," "," "," ","_"];`
  - Bracket enclosed `[]` quoted `" "` underscores seperated by commas `,`.
  - Blanking out an element `" "` will prevent an underscore from being rendered.
  - Underscores are rendered using the `underscore_font` variable.

- **Rotation** - A list for altering the default rotation of a particular element. In this example the number `5` will be rotated 90 degrees.

  ***Example:*** `d6_rotate=[0,0,90,0,0,0];`
  - Bracket enclosed `[]` non-quoted numbers (in degrees) seperated by commas `,`.
  - A zero value `0` will use the default rotation for that element.

- **Adjust Text Size** - A list for altering the text size of individual elements. In this example the size of number `1` will be increased.

  ***Example:*** `d6_adj_size=[15,0,0,0,0,0];`
  - Bracket enclosed `[]` non-quoted numbers seperated by commas `,`.
  - The values entered here will be added to the die's existing `d(n)_text_size` value.

- **Adjust Vertical Push** - A list for altering the vertical offset of individual elements. In this example the number `3` will be pushed up by `2`.

  ***Example:*** `d6_adj_v_push=[0,2,0,0,0,0];`
  - Bracket enclosed `[]` non-quoted numbers seperated by commas `,`.
  - The values entered here will be added to the die's existing `d(n)_text_v_push` value.

- **Adjust Horizontal Push** - A list for altering the horizontal offset of individual elements. In this example the number `3` will be pushed to the right by `2`.

  ***Example:*** `d6_adj_v_push=[0,2,0,0,0,0];`
  - Bracket enclosed `[]` non-quoted numbers seperated by commas `,`.
  - The values entered here will be added to the die's existing `d(n)_text_h_push` value.

- **Adjust Spacing** - A list for altering the spacing between double digit elements. In this example the spacing between the `1` and `2` in the number `12` of the `d12` will be increased by `0.2`.

  ***Example:*** `d12_adj_spacing=[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2,0];`
  - Bracket enclosed `[]` non-quoted numbers seperated by commas `,`.
  - The values entered here are added to the die's existing `d(n)_text_spacing` value.
  - Only avaliable where double digits are likely to occur.

- **Adjust Depth** - A list for altering the depth of individual elements. In this example the number `5` will be extruded by an assitional `0.5`mm.

  ***Example:*** `d6_adj_depth=[0,0,0.5,0,0,0];`
  - Bracket enclosed `[]` non-quoted numbers seperated by commas `,`.
  - The values entered here will be added to the global `text_depth` value.

***Note:** Some dice will not utilize all lists. The d4, for example, has no need for underscores, so that list is not avaliable.*

### Key Improvements

1. **Modular Structure**: Each die type is now in its own file (~150 lines each vs 1500+ line monolith)
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Configuration, utilities, and die-specific code are clearly separated
3. **Reusable Components**: Common functionality extracted into shared libraries
4. **Template System**: New dice can be easily added using the provided template
5. **Maintainability**: 90% reduction in file complexity, making debugging and modifications easier
6. **Extensibility**: New features can be added without affecting existing dice

### Usage

```bash
openscad PolyDiceGenerator.scad
```

All OpenSCAD Customizer parameters work exactly as before.

### Adding New Dice

1. Copy `src/dice/die_template.scad` to `src/dice/dX_name.scad`
2. Implement the geometry and parameters
3. Include in `PolyDiceGenerator.scad`
4. Add to the layout manager

### Technical Details

- **Backward Compatible**: All original features preserved
- **No Performance Impact**: Rendering time unchanged
- **Same Dependencies**: BOSL2 v2.0.716 required
- **Identical Output**: Produces the same STL files
